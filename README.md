## Intro

The project is an enhanced version of my previous project [Artist Search](https://github.com/zhichzhang/artist-search). Compared to the original, it has undergone a complete restructuring and optimization (with the frontend using Angular and Bootstrap, and the backend based on Express.js and MongoDB). Several new features have been added, including user authentication, session persistence and expiration management, artist favorite collections, artwork display, similar artist recommendations, artwork style term tags, and token refresh functionality.
